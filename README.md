# Judge V2: Homework Management System

Judge V2 organizes the exercises in the Java DB
course. In the courses, each homework is required to be in a zip format, which
will be evaluated by other students. The application will have an admin
functionality. Only the administrators can add new exercises and give out admin
roles to other users. The rest of the users can submit solutions to the specific
exercise, as well as evaluate the solutions of other students.
